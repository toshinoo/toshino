# Toshino
4chan quality of life improvements

Toshino is a userscript designed to co-exist with the native extension

## Install
You need a userscript manager to install toshino permanently, the recommended one is [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/).

Then you can just open [toshino.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toshinoo/toshino/main/toshino.user.js) in your browser and confirm the installation.

Toshino's menu will appear next to the 4chan's native settings menu on the navbar, below boards.

That's it!

### One-time use
If you don't have a userscript manager and you just want to try out the script, open [toshino.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toshinoo/toshino/main/toshino.user.js) in your browser, copy all contents, and paste the script to your browser's console (on 4chan). This way the script will be active until you reload the page. A convenient way to see if you like it.

## Common problems

### "I don't see the settings menu!"

You need to enable `persistent drop-down navigation bar` in `Navigation`

### "Strip 4chan links from tracking doesn't do anything!"

Enable `Linkify URLs` in `Miscellaneous`
